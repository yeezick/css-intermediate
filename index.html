        <p> It's not much, but I expect it to be ALOT more within the next year. I'd like to see if I can get involved
          in designing game engines so this website is destined to be <b> epic</b> one day. Anyway, get to know me!</p>

          My name is Erick Manrique & I am a self-teaching beginner software developer.
          Originally born in Argentina, I was raised on both sides of the Hudson River between NYC and New Jersey.
          Currently based in South Florida, I am never too far from the beach, the city, or the wildlife (Florida Man included).
          At the moment, I spend a lot of my free-time self-teaching myself how to code! The internet is...
          built for anyone willing to put in the work and learn software development. There's a long road ahead of me still, I wouldn't be here if not
          for my goals and interests. Below, I've helped visualize what those might be, check them out!

      <p> It's been a short & simple ride, but I hope it goes to show the interest and practice that goes into
        learning to be a developer. Regardless, it's been a blast letting you know who I am, but I'd love to
        hear from you too! </p>
      <p> Please reach out to me if you want to get connected or have any questions! Any one of the methods
        below will work, but if you're here regarding work, here is my <a href='images/emRes.pdf'> resume</a>.
